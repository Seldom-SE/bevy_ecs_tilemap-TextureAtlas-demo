# bevy_ecs_tilemap-TextureAtlas-demo

This is a demonstration of a potential inconsistency when using generated `TextureAtlas`es as sprite sheets for `bevy_ecs_tilemap`. I could just be missing something though.

The code is basically just [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`'s `map` example](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap/blob/main/examples/map.rs) and [Bevy's `texture_atlas` example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/release-0.5.1/examples/2d/texture_atlas.rs) mashed together.
